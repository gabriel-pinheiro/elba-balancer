# Elba Headers Module

Elba adds some headers to responses to help with troubleshooting. The following headers will be sent:

- `X-Elba-Id`: The ID of the request, all the logs related to it will have a `trace=<id>` tag.
  - Logs not related to a request will have a `trace=000000000000` tag.
  - Every reponse will have this header.
  - For more informations check the [logs module documentation](./logs.md).
- `X-Elba-Target`: The target that was chosen to respond to the request
  - If all targets are down and `service.health.none_healthy_is_all_healthy` is set to `false` this header will **not** be added to the `503` response generated by Elba.
  - To understand how targets are chosen, check the [load balance module documentation](./load-balance.md).
- `X-Elba-Attempts`: The amount of attempts that were made to reach the target
  - If all targets are down and `service.health.none_healthy_is_all_healthy` is set to `false` this header will **not** be added to the `503` response generated by Elba.
  - This includes the first attempt, `1` means one attempt, no retries; `2` means one attempt and one retry. And so on.
  - To understand how retries work, check the [retry module documentation](./retry.md).
